# PyTOUGHREACT

PyTOUGHREACT is a Python package for automating reactive transport simulations including biodegradation reactions.
It makes use of TOUGHREACT, TMVOC and TMVOCBIO executables for running the simulations. These executables are interfaced
with python to automate the runs. It will be particularly useful for uncertainty quantifications, sensitivity 
analysis without the need to have a lot of files stored on your local computer. It builds on the PyTOUGH software which 
only processes for the TOUGH2 software.

## Installation

PyTOUGHREACT is available on PyPI which is a repository for softwares built with the Python Programming Language. Before 
installing PyTOUGHREACT, it is required to have Python >=3.7 installed on your local computer. 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyTOUGHREACT.
