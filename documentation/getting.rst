Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The first step to using Pytoughreact is to ensure python is installed on your local system.
  While pytoughreact is compatible with versions 3.7 and above of python. It is recommended to download 
  the latest version of python.

* Python can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/ for any operating system

* Installing in python can be done by following the installation link. For Windows first time users,
  ensure python is placed in your system path before starting to use python.

* After python has been installed, preferably download an IDE (e.g VSCode, PyCharm etc) for your development work.
  The IDEs take on a lot of your task such as auto code completion, environment management etc.

* After your IDE has been downloaded, it is advised to use a virtual environment to manage the packages
  that will be used for this project. Python virtual environments can be installled using instructions 
  from https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html, https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
  Ensure to create and activate your virtual environment. Alternatively, conda can be used for environment 
  management and instructions for how to use conda can be found here (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)
  Note: The use of conda is yet to be tested for PyTOUGHREACT but it is a well known development process and
  should function fine.

* After creating and activating your virtual environment, open a new terminal and install pytoughreact
  using the pip package manager. This can be done by following the instructions on the installation
  page

* A sample simulation can be run using examples in the Example page for both biodegradation and reaction
  simulations
